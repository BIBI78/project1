* No errors were returned when passing through the official CSS [W3 validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) except this ![one](assets/images/cssBUG.png) which I decided to keep because this is how I wanted my code.


# Unfixed Bugs 

* I get an error when I highlight the the page the user is currently on in the navigation bar.
* The bootstrap style sheet and my own style sheets conflicct but I found a way around it.
* The footer styling was a bit tricky for some reason and I didnt get to do everything I wanted.
* The Meditation page I did not really know what to add to it , it seemed superflous.
